#  Lucky Haunter Game Helps You Hide Casino Winnings from the IRS

Lucky Haunter, the spooky new casino game, may help you avoid paying taxes on your gambling winnings. The IRS doesn't consider money you win gambling income, as long as it's not your regular source of income. So if you play Lucky Haunter and hit the jackpot, the IRS can't touch your winnings!

The game is based on the classic Pac-Man arcade game. In it, you navigate a yellow square around a maze, eating dots and avoiding ghosts. The more dots you eat, the bigger your score. In addition to the regular dots, there are also bonus items that appear occasionally. If you eat one of these bonus items, your character turns into a giant dot that can eat other players for bonus points.

There are two ways to win in Lucky Haunter. The first is to eat all of the dots in the maze. The second is to catch the ghost. When you catch the ghost, your opponent's character disappears and you get their points.

Lucky Haunter is available now at all major online casinos. So put on your spookiest costume and see if you can beat the ghosts!
