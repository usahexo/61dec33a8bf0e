The club’s dominating play starts with its top players. Center Walter Tavares is a dominant force in the paint, averaging over 10 rebounds per game in the Spanish League. Point guard Pedro Martinez is one of Europe’s most prolific passers, creating opportunities for his teammates to score. And at 6’11”, shooting guard Fernando San Emeterio can shoot over almost any defender.

The club’s success has continued into the current season. On January 11th, they defeated defending Euroleague champions Real Madrid 103-88. That win came as no surprise to sports bettors; Valencia had been installed as a three-point favorite going into the game.
