#  How to Upholster a Blackjack Table for Cheap

##Materials

* A blackjack table or at least a sturdy surface to upholster

* A staple gun

* A hammer
 (optional)

* A screwdriver (optional)

* Fabric (enough to cover the table surface) 
- Upholstery fabric is best, but any durable fabric will do 
- If using a solid color, get two yards 
- If using a pattern, get three yards 
* Foam padding (1/2" to 1" thickness) 
- If you can only find foam that is thicker than 1", you can layer two pieces together to achieve the desired thickness 
* Batting (the same width as the table top) 
- Polyester batting is best, but cotton batting will also work 

##Instructions:

1. Remove the top of the blackjack table and set it aside. If your table has a metal frame, you will need to unscrew the screws that hold it in place before taking it off. If your table doesn't have a metal frame, you can skip this step. 
2. Cut your fabric to fit the surface of the table. It should be slightly bigger than the table so you have some wiggle room to staple it in place. 
3. Use the staple gun to secure the fabric to the table. Start in one corner and work your way across, making sure that the fabric is tight against the surface. If there are any wrinkles in the fabric, use a hammer to smooth them out. 
4. Cut a piece of foam that fits snugly against the fabric on all sides. Use the staple gun to attach it in place. Make sure that there are no gaps between the foam and the fabric. 	5. Cut a piece of batting that is slightly larger than the foam pad. Place it overtop of the foam pad and secure it in place with staples or duct tape.

 Materials:

-Poker table
-Upholstery fabric
-Foam rubber or batting
-Tacks or staples
-Needle and thread
-Scissors
-Ruler or tape measure

Step One: Choose the Fabric
The first step is to choose the fabric you want to use. You'll need a fairly sturdy fabric that can stand up to wear and tear. Cotton, tweed, and vinyl are all good options. Measure the surface of your poker table and buy enough fabric to cover it completely. The fabric should also be slightly wider than the table so you'll have some excess to trim later.

Step Two: Prep the Fabric
Once you have your fabric, you'll need to prep it for upholstery. If your table has a wooden frame, you'll need to cut the fabric so that it's about 1 inch wider than the frame on all sides. If your table doesn't have a frame, just cut the fabric so that it's a few inches larger than the table surface. Then, using a needle and thread, sew a hem around all four edges of the fabric. This will keep it from fraying when you staple or tack it in place.

Step Three: Add Foam Rubber or Batting
If you want, you can add some foam rubber or batting to your fabric before attaching it to the table. This will make the upholstery more comfortable to sit on and will help protect the table from damage. Cut a piece of foam rubber or batting that's big enough to cover the entire surface of the fabric. Then, using a staple gun or tacks, attach it to the back of the fabric. Make sure everything is nice and secure so it won't move around once attached to the table.




 Step Four: Attach Fabric to Table
Now it's time to attach the fabric to the poker table. Start by placing one edge of the fabric against one side of the table and staple or tack it in place. Make sure everything is straight and even before moving on to the next side. Once all four sides are attached, go over them again with a hammer stapler (if needed) to ensure they're nice and secure. Trim any excess fabric from around the edges of the table.

#  DIY: How to Upholster Your Own Poker Table

Do you want to add a custom touch to your poker table, but don’t want to spend the money on a professional upholsterer? Or maybe you just need a new poker table and don’t have the budget for one. No problem! You can easily upholster your own poker table.

The supplies you will need are: cloth or vinyl fabric, staple gun, measuring tape, scissors, straight edge, and a pen or pencil.

First, measure the surface of your poker table. This will dictate how much fabric you will need. Cut the fabric to size, making sure to leave an extra inch on all sides for seam allowance.

Next, place the fabric wrong side up on your work surface. With the staple gun, staple one corner of the fabric to the table. Pull the fabric tight as you staple it in place. Work your way around the table, stapling each corner in place. Make sure that the fabric is taut and smooth as you go.

If there are any areas where the fabric is puckering or bunching up, use a straight edge and pen or pencil to make a light mark across the area. Then use scissors to cut along the line. Be careful not to cut into the underlying material of your poker table.

Once all of the fabric is in place, use a seam sealant (optional) to keep it from unraveling over time. Let dry according to manufacturer’s instructions.

There you have it! Your very own custom-upholstered poker table!

#  How to Re-cover a Blackjack Table for Cheap

##Overview
  Re-covering a blackjack table is a relatively easy process, and can be done relatively cheaply if you have the right materials. In this article we'll walk through the process of re-covering a blackjack table, as well as provide tips on how to do it cheaply.

##Materials  In order to re-cover a blackjack table, you'll need the following materials: 
-Plywood
-Felt

##The Process  The process of re-covering a blackjack table is relatively simple. First, you'll need to cut the plywood to size using a cutting knife. You'll then need to staple the felt to the top of the plywood. Finally, you'll need to use a hot glue gun to attach the felt border. Here's a more detailed look at each step:
1. Cut the Plywood: Use a cutting knife to cut the plywood to size. Be sure to measure twice and cut once, as it's important that the plywood is the correct size for your table. 2. Staple Felt: Stapling the felt is probably the most time consuming part of this process. Be sure to staple it tightly so that there are no wrinkles in the felt. 3. Attach Border: Use a hot glue gun to attach the felt border around the edge of the table. Make sure that there are no gaps between the felt and the edge of the table. 4. Finished! Your table is now ready for use!

#  How to Upholster a Table for Free

One of the best ways to add some personality to your living space on a budget is by upholstering furniture. It can be as simple as adding a few throw pillows to a plain couch or chair, or as involved as completely reupholstering an existing piece of furniture. In this article, we'll show you how to upholster a table for free using some basic supplies and techniques.

You'll need:

-A flat surface on which to work (a table or countertop is ideal)
-An upholstery staple gun
-Staple remover
-Scissors
-Upholstery fabric of your choice
-Pins
-Tape measure
-Chalk or a pencil
-Hot glue gun (optional)

1. Begin by measuring the surface of your table. Add 12 inches to both the width and the length, then cut your fabric accordingly. This will give you enough fabric to wrap around all four sides of the table. If you're working with a particularly large or round table, you may need more fabric; just make sure that the extra fabric is folded and secured so that it doesn't hang off the edge of the table.
2. Tape the fabric in place around all four sides of the table, using pins if necessary to keep it in place. Make sure that there are no wrinkles in the fabric; use a hot glue gun if needed to smooth out any bumps or ridges.
3. Staple the fabric in place around all four edges of the table, using a staple gun. Start in one corner and work your way around, being careful not to staple too close to the edge so that it's difficult to pull tight. If you're having trouble getting good leverage with the staple gun, try using a hammer to tap them into place instead. 
4. Once all of the staples are in place, use a staple remover to remove any extra staples and neaten up the edges of the fabric. You're now done!
