#  What is the Book of Pharao?

The Book of Pharao is an ancient Egyptian funerary text, one of the earliest known corpus of religious texts from ancient Egypt. It was probably composed during the Middle Kingdom (2050-1650 BC) and came to be used as a funerary work in the New Kingdom (1550-1070 BC). The Book of Pharao contains spells and incantations that were intended to help the deceased in their journey through the underworld, and protect them from harmful spirits along the way.

The Book of Pharao is divided into two parts: the first part is focused on preparing the deceased for their journey through the underworld, while the second part contains spells and incantations that were meant to protect them from harm. One of the most famous spells from the Book of Pharao is the “Weighing of the Heart” ritual, in which the heart of the deceased is weighed against Ma’at, an Egyptian goddess representing truth and justice. If the heart is found to be lighter than Ma’at, then the deceased is allowed to enter into paradise; if it is found to be heavier than Ma’at, then they are condemned to eternal damnation.

The Book of Pharao was discovered at Thebes in 1855 by Émile Amélineau, and has been translated into many languages since its discovery. It remains an important source of information about ancient Egyptian religion and culture, and continues to be studied by scholars around the world.
