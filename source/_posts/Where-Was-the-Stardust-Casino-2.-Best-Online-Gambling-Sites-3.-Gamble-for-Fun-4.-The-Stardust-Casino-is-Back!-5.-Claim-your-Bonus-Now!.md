The Stardust Casino was a hotel and casino on the Las Vegas Strip. It was demolished in 2007 to make way for the Echelon Place development. The Stardust opened in 1958 as the first resort on the Strip.

The Stardust was known for its innovative design, which included a giant space-themed sign and a 120-foot (37 m) tower that shot fireworks every hour. It also featured a large casino and showroom.

The casino closed in 1991 and reopened as the Starcruiser Casino. It closed again in 2000 and reopened as the Stardust Resort and Casino. The resort closed in 2006 and was demolished the following year.

3 Gamble for Fun

  Gambing can be an exciting way to pass the time, but it can also be risky if you're not careful. Here are a few tips for enjoying gambling without risking too much:


 1. Don't bet more than you can afford to lose – Gambling should be fun, not stressful! Don't gamble with money you need for bills or other expenses.
2. Stick to games you know – If you're not familiar with how a particular game works, stick to games you do know how to play until you're comfortable enough to try something new.  3 Bet small amounts at first – When you're starting out, it's best to bet small amounts until you get a feel for how the game works. There's no need to risk too much money right away! 4 Use sound financial judgement – Just like with any other type of investment, don't gamble with money you can't afford to lose! 5 Have fun! – Gambling should be enjoyable–not stressful! So have some fun with it and don't take things too seriously!
